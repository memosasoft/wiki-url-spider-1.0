Found free conpets: it is often thought that the field of american women s history became a major field of academic inquiry largely after the     s                 however  the field has a longer historiography than is generally understood  the earliest histories of american women were authored during the   th century  largely by non academic women writers writing for popular audiences or to document the history of women s civic and activist organizations  for example  abolitionists sarah grimke and lydia maria child wrote brief histories of women in the     s  while elizabeth ellet wrote women of the american revolution         a domestic history of the american revolution         and pioneer women of the west              meanwhile  women s organizations like the women s christian temperance union  national american woman suffrage association  and national association of colored women set about writing their own institutional histories in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century  while women s patriotic societies like the daughters of the american revolution and the united daughters of the confederacy created  filiopietistic  publications on history and women in history  developed school curricula  and engaged in historic preservation work       both black and white women in women s clubs actively participated in this work during the twentieth century in their efforts to shape the broader culture       in the early twentieth century  for example  the united daughters of the confederacy  udc  coordinated efforts across the south to tell the story of the confederacy and its women on the confederate home front  while male historians spent their time with battles and generals  the women emphasized female activism  initiative  and leadership  they reported that when all the men left for war  the women took command  found ersatz and substitute foods  rediscovered their old traditional skills with the spinning wheel when factory cloth became unavailable  and ran all the farm or plantation operations  they faced danger without having men in the traditional role of their protectors       historian jacquelyn dowd hall argues that the udc was a powerful promoter of women s history udc leaders were determined to assert women s cultural authority over virtually every representation of the region s past  this they did by lobbying for state archives and museums  national historic sites  and historic highways  compiling genealogies  interviewing former soldiers  writing history textbooks  and erecting monuments  which now moved triumphantly from cemeteries into town centers  more than half a century before women s history and public history emerged as fields of inquiry and action  the udc  with other women s associations  strove to etch women s accomplishments into the historical record and to take history to the people  from the nursery and the fireside to the schoolhouse and the public square      while non academic women in these societies succeeded in shaping public memory and history education in american school houses  albeit along racially segregated lines  the subject of women in american history was largely ignored within the historical discipline during the period in which the discipline professionalized from the     s to            the male dominated discipline saw its purview as relatively limited to the study of the evolution of politics  government  and the law  and emphasized research in official state documents  thus leaving little room for an examination of women s activities or lives            women s activities were perceived as irretrievable  inadequately documented in the historical record  and occurring in the social and cultural realms  however  with the rise of progressive history in the     s and social history in the     s and     s  some professional historians began to call for more attention to the study of women in american history  or simply incorporated women into their broader historical studies without fanfare       the most famous call to research and write about the history of american women in this period came from distinguished historian arthur schlesinger  sr  in his collected essays published as new perspectives in american history  in       his graduate students and their graduate students would later contribute to the emergence of the scholarly field of american women s history in the ensuing decades  this phase in the field s development culminated in the creation of women s history archives at both radcliffe college  harvard s women s college  and smith college  the sophia smith collection   the arthur and elizabeth schlesinger library on the history of women in america at harvard  for example  was founded in      as the radcliffe woman s archives  between      and       this library produced a seminal scholarly reference work on women in american history  notable american women  a biographical dictionary                    it coordinated the work of hundreds of historians men and women and was published to widespread acclaim in        academic historians  meanwhile  sporadically produced

Found free conpets: methods edit

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: there are several methods for the measuring of crime  public surveys are occasionally conducted to estimate the amount of crime that has not been reported to police  such surveys are usually more reliable for assessing trends  however  they also have their limitations and generally don t procure statistics useful for local crime prevention  often ignore offenses against children and do not count offenders brought before the criminal justice system

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: law enforcement agencies in some countries offer compilations of statistics for various types of crime

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: two major methods for collecting crime data are law enforcement reports  which only reflect crimes that are reported  recorded  and not subsequently canceled  and victim study  victimization statistical surveys   which rely on individual memory and honesty  for less frequent crimes such as intentional homicide and armed robbery  reported incidences are generally more reliable  but suffer from under recording  for example  no criming in the united kingdom sees over one third of reported violent crimes being not recorded by the police     because laws and practices vary between jurisdictions  comparing crime statistics between and even within countries can be difficult  typically only violent deaths  homicide or manslaughter  can reliably be compared  due to consistent and high reporting and relative clear definition

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: the u s  has two major data collection programs  the uniform crime reports from the fbi and the national crime victimization survey from the bureau of justice statistics  however  the u s  has no comprehensive infrastructure to monitor crime trends and report the information to related parties such as law enforcement

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: research using a series of victim surveys in    countries of the european union  funded by the european commission  has reported        that the level of crime in europe has fallen back to the levels of       and notes that levels of common crime have shown declining trends in the u s   canada  australia and other industrialized countries as well  the european researchers say a general consensus identifies demographic change as the leading cause for this international trend  although homicide and robbery rates rose in the u s  in the     s  by the end of the century they had declined by

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: however  the european research suggests that  increased use of crime prevention measures may indeed be the common factor behind the near universal decrease in overall levels of crime in the western world   since decreases have been most pronounced in property crime and less so  if at all  in contact crimes

Found free conpets: counting rules edit

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: relatively few standards exist and none that permit international comparability beyond a very limited range of offences  however  many jurisdictions accept the following

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: there must be a prima facie case that an offence has been committed before it is recorded  that is either police find evidence of an offence or receive a believable allegation of an offense being committed  some jurisdictions count offending only when certain processes happen  such as an arrest is made  ticket issued  charges laid in court or only upon securing a conviction

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: multiple reports of the same offence usually count as one offence  some jurisdictions count each report separately  others count each victim of offending separately

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: where several offences are committed at the same time  in one act of offending  only the most serious offense is counted  some jurisdictions record and count each and every offense separately  others count cases  or offenders  that can be prosecuted

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: where multiple offenders are involved in the same act of offending only one act is counted when counting offenses but each offender is counted when apprehended

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: offending is counted at the time it comes to the attention of a law enforcement officer  some jurisdictions record and count offending at the time it occurs

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: as  only causing pain  is counted as assault in some countries  it let higher assault rates except in austria  finland  germany  the netherlands  portugal and sweden  but there are exceptions  like czech republic and latvia  france was the contrasting exception having a high assault ratio without counting minor assaults

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: offending that is a breach of the law but for which no punishment exists is often not counted  for example  suicide  which is technically illegal in most countries  may not be counted as a crime  although attempted suicide and assisting suicide are

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: also traffic offending and other minor offending that might be dealt with by using fines rather than imprisonment  is often not counted as crime  however separate statistics may be kept for this sort of offending

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: surveys edit

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: because of the difficulties in quantifying how much crime actually occurs  researchers generally take two approaches to gathering statistics about crime

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: however  as officers can only record crime that comes to their attention and might not record a matter as a crime if the matter is considered minor and is not perceived as a crime by the officer concerned

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: for example  when faced with a domestic violence dispute between a couple  a law enforcement officer may decide it is far less trouble to arrest the male party to the dispute  because the female may have children to care for  despite both parties being equally culpable for the dispute  this sort of pragmatic decisionmaking asked if they are victims of crime  without needing to provide any supporting evidence  in these surveys it is the participant s perception  or opinion  that a crime occurred  or even their understanding about what constitutes a crime that is being measured

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: as a consequence differing methodologies may make comparisons with other surveys difficult

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: one way in which  while other types of crime are under reported  these surveys also give insights as to why crime is reported  or not  the surveys show that the need to make an insurance claim  seek medical assistance  and the seriousness of an offence tend to increase the level of reporting  while the inconvenience of reporting  the involvement of intimate partners and the nature of the offending tend to decrease reporting

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: this allows degrees of confidence to be assigned to various crime statistics  for example  motor vehicle thefts are generally well reported because the victim may need to make the report for an insurance claim  while domestic violence  domestic child abuse and sexual offences are frequently significantly under reported because of the intimate relationships involved  embarrassment and other factors that make it difficult for the victim to make a report

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: attempts to use victimisation surveys from different countries for international comparison had failed in the past  a standardised survey project called the international crime victims survey    results from this project have been briefly discussed earlier in this article

Found free conpets: classification edit

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: while most jurisdictions could probably agree about what constitutes a murder  what constitutes a homicide may be more problematic  while a crime against the person could vary widely  legislation differences often means the ingredients of offences vary between jurisdictions

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: the international crime victims survey has been done in over    countries to date and has been a  de facto  standard for defining common crimes  complete list of countries    participating and the    defined crimes     can be found at the project web site

Found free conpets: in march      the unodc published the first version of the international classification of crime for statistical purposes  iccs

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: measures edit

Free concpets concept: crime statistics txt

Found free conpets: more complex measures involve measuring the numbers of discrete victims and offenders as well as repeat victimisation rates and recidivism  repeat victimisation involves measuring how often the same victim is subjected to a repeat occurrence of an offence  often by the same offender  repetition rate measures are often used to assess the effectiveness of interventions

Free concpets concept: anxiety txt

Found free conpets: the microbes of the gut can connect with the brain to affect anxiety  there are various pathways along which this communication can take place  one is through the major neurotransmitters      the gut microbes such as bifidobacterium and bacillus produce the neurotransmitters gaba and dopamine  respectively      the neurotransmitters signal to the nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract  and those signals will be carried to the brain through the vagus nerve or the spinal system              this is demonstrated by the fact that altering the microbiome has shown anxiety  and depression reducing effects in mice  but not in subjects without vagus nerves

Free concpets concept: anxiety txt

Found free conpets: another key pathway is the hpa axis  as mentioned above      the microbes can control the levels of cytokines in the body  and altering cytokine levels creates direct effects on areas of the brain such as the hypothalmus  the area that triggers hpa axis activity  the hpa axis regulates production of cortisol  a hormone that takes part in the body s stress response      when hpa activity spikes  cortisol levels increase  processing and reducing anxiety in stressful situations  these pathways  as well as the specific effects of individual taxa of microbes  are not yet completely clear  but the communication between the gut microbiome and the brain is undeniable  as is the ability of these pathways to alter anxiety levels

Free concpets concept: anxiety txt

Found free conpets: many studies in the past used a candidate gene approach to test whether single genes were associated with anxiety  these investigations were based on hypotheses about how certain known genes influence neurotransmitters  such as serotonin and norepinephrine  and hormones  such as cortisol  that are implicated in anxiety  none of these findings are well replicated      with the possible exception of tmem   d  comt and mao a      the epigenetic signature of bdnf  a gene that codes for a protein called brain derived neurotrophic factor that is found in the brain  has also been associated with anxiety and specific patterns of neural activity      and a receptor gene for bdnf called ntrk  was associated with anxiety in a large genome wide investigation      the reason that most candidate gene findings have not replicated is that anxiety is a complex trait that is influenced by many genomic variants  each of which has a small effect on its own  increasingly  studies of anxiety are using a hypothesis free approach to look for parts of the genome that are implicated in anxiety using big enough samples to find associations with variants that have small effects  the largest explorations of the common genetic architecture of anxiety have been facilitated by the uk biobank  the angst consortium and the crc fear  anxiety and anxiety disorders
